Study documentation of multiple courses related to data science.
The code in the repository are, at the most part, coded and modified by me based on the lectures, however some specific files/code are original files from
the respective teacher, as so I will try to markdown those specific ones and give due credit to the owner, also being open to take down / modify any give file
by request of the original teacher as long as resonable.
